# Log Structured File System: Disk Organization
Implementation of a log-structured file system imitation with a focus on disk organization where the user will be able to get the text file from a Linux or Mac system and will be able to read, update, and delete the file from the log-structured file system. Here buffer cache will be handled by the host operating system memory management.
